# IMAGE REPOSITORY.

## Introduction

This is a Image Repository for uploading image fast and easy for storage, it gives registered users the ability to upload one or bulk images in any format at once.


## Technologies Used

#### 1. Google Cloud Storage.

There are several good cloud storage platforms but also I made use of Google Cloud Storage because it provides worldwide, highly durable object storage that scales to exabytes of data, it is also built to easily optimize price and performance, which I used due to easy access to data instantly, store images and also retrieve them anytime.

#### 2. Redis

I utilize redis to make easy access to images faster because Redis is very fast and can perform about 81000 GETs per second, and also supports data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, and sorted sets with range queries, bitmaps, hyperloglogs, and geospatial indexes with radius queries.

#### 3.   JWT - Authentication
#### 4.   PHP [Laravel] - Framework
#### 5.   MYSQL  - Database
